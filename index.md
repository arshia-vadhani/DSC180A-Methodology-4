**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter is tool-use for complex LLM tasks.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation we would like to pursue for our Quarter 2 Project would be a tool use agent and an evaluator. We would want an LLM to determine when to use a tool to answer a question and when switch to reasoning mode with internal reasoning to answer the question.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would want to make in the approach taken in my current project is to narrow down the domain that I chose to something smaller and easier to implement. MedMCP is too broad and would be hard to implement in the few weeks I had. It would have been nice to get some experience working to build the benchmark evaluator.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Some technique I would be interested in using is Open-source code to evaluate the LLM's ability to handle external API keys for tool usage and when the best time to use internal reasoning is. We would want to be able to evaluate which choice is best and how accurate that choice is. We are also interested in utilizing an external tool to search for API's to evaluate on.
